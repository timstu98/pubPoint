# Chosen to make this modular. Means testing will be easier to carry out. Ensure this module does not depend on anything Flask related. This will make it easier to test in a standalone way.
# Take all inputs as arguments

# Currently takes a list of all users and all pubs as input. Down the line, this can be changed to take a group_id and query pubs from the database based upon say lat and lng, which will make the function ultimately more modular and easier to test, and also more efficient.
